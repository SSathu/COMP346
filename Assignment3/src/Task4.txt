Inside the Monitor, we are able to establish a first come, first served dining policy by implementing a priority queue, which allows philosophers to cease trying to eat at the same time. In order to prevent philosophers from perpetually being in the eating state, there is also a time limit on how long they can eat. Overall, a time limit on eating and a priority set based on first come first served will allow for there to be prevention of starvation.
